## 1. Flexibility vs. Mobility

**Flexibility**: Passive range of motion at a joint (how far a muscle can be lengthened). Improved by stretching.

**Mobility**: Active range of motion — the ability to move through a range under your own muscular control. Requires both flexibility AND strength at end range.

**Practical implication**: Users who "just want to be more flexible" often actually need mobility work (active control), not just passive stretching. Always include active components.

## 2. Stretching Protocols

### Types of Stretching (ACSM 2022 recommendations)

| Type | Description | When to Use | Duration |
|------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Static stretching** | Hold a stretch at end range, no movement | Post-workout cooldown; dedicated flexibility sessions | 15-60 sec per stretch, 2-4 reps (ACSM) |
| **Dynamic stretching** | Controlled movement through range of motion | Pre-workout warm-up | 10-15 reps per movement |
| **PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)** | Contract-relax cycles to increase ROM | Dedicated flexibility sessions, with a partner or wall | 6-sec contract / 10-30 sec stretch, 2-4 cycles |
| **Ballistic stretching** | Bouncing at end range | NOT recommended for general population — injury risk | — |

### ACSM Flexibility Recommendations

- Frequency: ≥2-3 days/week, ideally daily
- Hold: 15-60 seconds per stretch (60 sec for older adults)
- Repetitions: 2-4 per muscle group
- Intensity: To the point of tightness or slight discomfort, NOT pain
- Total: At least 60 seconds per muscle group per session

### Pre-Workout: Dynamic Stretching

Static stretching before exercise can temporarily reduce power output (Kay & Blazevich, 2012 meta-analysis). For pre-workout, use dynamic stretching:
- Leg swings (front/back, side to side)
- Arm circles
- Hip circles
- Walking lunges with rotation
- Inchworms
- High knees / butt kicks

### Post-Workout: Static Stretching

After training, muscles are warm and more receptive to stretching:
- Hold 20-30 sec (minimum), 45-60 sec for greater gains
- Focus on muscles trained that session
- Breathe normally, do not hold breath

## 4. Pilates Programming

### Mat Pilates Session Structure

**Beginner (30-40 min):**
1. Breathing + centering (3 min)
2. Warm-up: Pelvic tilts, Spine stretch (5 min)
3. Core series: The Hundred (modified), Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Criss-Cross (10-15 min)

### Pilates Principles

The 6 principles (Joseph Pilates): Concentration, Control, Center, Precision, Breath, Flow. Cue the user to focus on quality over quantity — 8 precise reps beats 20 sloppy ones.

### When to Recommend Pilates

- Core weakness or low back pain (strong evidence for Pilates in chronic low back pain management per Cochrane review, Wells et al. 2014)
- Post-natal reconditioning (after medical clearance)
- Users who want low-impact, controlled movement
- Complement to running/cycling (addresses hip stability and core deficits)
- Older adults seeking balance and fall prevention

## 5. Posture Correction Programs

### Common Postural Imbalances

**Upper Crossed Syndrome (Janda)**
- Tight: Upper trapezius, levator scapulae, pectoralis major/minor, suboccipitals
- Weak: Deep neck flexors, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids
- Appearance: Forward head, rounded shoulders, increased thoracic kyphosis

**Lower Crossed Syndrome (Janda)**
- Tight: Hip flexors (iliopsoas), erector spinae (lumbar)
- Weak: Abdominals (deep core), gluteus maximus
- Appearance: Anterior pelvic tilt, increased lumbar lordosis, protruding abdomen

### Corrective Exercise Protocol (NASM model)

For each imbalance, follow: **Inhibit → Lengthen → Activate → Integrate**

**Upper Crossed Syndrome program:**

1. Inhibit (foam roll / massage ball): Upper trapezius, pec minor — 30-60 sec each
2. Lengthen (stretch): Chest doorway stretch 30 sec × 2, Upper trap stretch 30 sec × 2 each side
3. Activate (isolated strengthening): Chin tucks ×10, Prone Y raises ×10, Band pull-aparts ×15
4. Integrate (compound movement): Wall slides ×10, Face pulls (band) ×12

**Lower Crossed Syndrome program:**

1. Inhibit: Hip flexors, lumbar erectors — 30-60 sec each
2. Lengthen: Half-kneeling hip flexor stretch 30 sec × 2, Figure-4 stretch 30 sec × 2
3. Activate: Glute bridges ×15, Dead bugs ×10 each side, Bird dogs ×10 each side
4. Integrate: Goblet squat with focus on neutral spine ×10, Farmer's walk 30m

### Posture Correction Frequency

- Corrective exercises: Daily or at minimum 5×/week (brief, 10-15 min)
- Takes 4-8 weeks to see noticeable postural changes
- Must be combined with awareness of daily habits (desk setup, phone posture, sleeping position)

## 7. Programming for Desk Workers / Sedentary Populations

### The Problem

Prolonged sitting (>8 hours/day) is independently associated with increased mortality and morbidity, even in people who exercise (Ekelund et al., 2016 meta-analysis in The Lancet). The solution is both structured exercise AND reduced sedentary time.

### Movement Breaks

Recommend "movement snacks" throughout the workday:
- Every 30-60 min: Stand and move for 1-3 minutes
- Options: Walk to get water, desk stretches, bodyweight squats ×10, wall push-ups ×10
- These reduce the harmful effects of prolonged sitting

### Desk Worker Weekly Program

| Day | Content | Duration | Focus |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|
| Mon | Upper Crossed corrective + walk | 15 min + 20 min walk | Posture reset |
| Tue | Full body strength (bodyweight or gym) | 30-45 min | Compound movements |
| Wed | Hip mobility + thoracic mobility | 20 min | Counteract sitting posture |
| Thu | Full body strength | 30-45 min | Compound movements |
| Fri | Lower Crossed corrective + yoga | 15 min + 20 min yoga | Posture + flexibility |
| Sat | Active recreation: walk, hike, cycle, swim | 30-60 min | Enjoy movement |
| Sun | Rest or gentle stretching | 0-15 min | Recovery |

### Key Exercises for Desk Workers

Prioritize these movements in any desk worker's program:
- **Glute bridges**: Counteracts hip flexor tightness and glute inhibition from sitting
- **Face pulls / band pull-aparts**: Counteracts rounded shoulders
- **Dead bugs**: Retrains deep core activation
- **Hip flexor stretches**: Addresses adaptive shortening from sitting
- **Thoracic extensions**: Counteracts thoracic kyphosis
- **Chin tucks**: Addresses forward head posture

## 8. Foam Rolling — Evidence Summary

### What the Evidence Shows

- **DOMS reduction**: Small-to-moderate effect on reducing perceived muscle soreness (Pearcey et al., 2015; Wiewelhove et al., 2019 meta-analysis). Does NOT accelerate actual tissue repair.
- **Acute ROM improvement**: Short-term increases in ROM (5-10 min) without the performance decrease seen with static stretching (Cheatham et al., 2015 systematic review). Good pre-workout option.
- **"Breaking up adhesions/scar tissue"**: This popular claim is NOT supported by evidence. The pressures generated by foam rolling are insufficient to deform fascial tissue. The mechanism is likely neurological (pain modulation, reduced muscle tone).
- **Performance**: No consistent evidence that foam rolling improves strength, power, or sprint performance.

### Practical Recommendations

- Useful as warm-up (1-2 min per area) before training for ROM improvement
- Useful post-workout or on rest days for perceived recovery
- 30-60 sec per muscle group, moderate pressure (uncomfortable but not painful)
- Roll slowly (2-3 cm per second), pause on tender spots
- Avoid rolling directly over bones, joints, or the lower back (lumbar spine)

## 9. Prehab (Injury Prevention) Routines

### General Prehab Principles

"Prehab" = proactive exercises to prevent common injuries. Most effective when targeting the specific demands of the user's sport or activities.

### Universal Prehab (include 2-3×/week in any program)

1. **Band pull-aparts** × 15 — shoulder health
2. **External rotation (band)** × 12 each — rotator cuff
3. **Glute bridges** × 15 — glute activation, low back protection
4. **Bird dogs** × 8 each side — core stability, spinal health
5. **Calf raises** × 15 — Achilles/calf health (especially for runners)
6. **Ankle circles** × 10 each — joint mobility

### Sport-Specific Prehab Additions

| Activity | Add These |
|----------|----------|
| Running | Nordic hamstring curls, clamshells, single-leg balance |
| Overhead sports (volleyball, swimming, throwing) | Serratus punches, face pulls, thoracic mobility |
| Contact sports | Neck isometrics, proprioceptive balance drills |
| Desk work → gym | Thoracic extensions, hip flexor stretch, chin tucks |
