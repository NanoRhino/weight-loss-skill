## 1. Older Adults (65+)

### ACSM / WHO Recommendations

- **Aerobic**: ≥150 min/week moderate OR ≥75 min/week vigorous (same as general adults)
- **Strength**: ≥2 days/week, moderate-to-high intensity, all major muscle groups
- **Balance**: ≥3 days/week for fall prevention (critical addition for older adults)
- **Flexibility**: ≥2 days/week, holding stretches 30-60 sec (longer holds recommended for older adults per ACSM)

### Programming Priorities (in order)

1. **Fall prevention**: Balance training is the #1 priority unique to this population. Single-leg stands, tandem walks, heel-to-toe walking, Tai Chi.
2. **Functional strength**: Emphasis on movements used in daily life — sit-to-stand (chair squat), step-ups, carrying objects, reaching overhead.
3. **Bone density maintenance**: Weight-bearing and resistance exercises. Impact activities (walking, stair climbing) stimulate bone more than non-impact (swimming, cycling).
4. **Cardiovascular health**: Brisk walking is the most evidence-supported and practical modality.
5. **Flexibility & mobility**: Maintain joint ROM for daily function.

### Exercise Modifications

| Standard Exercise | Modification for Older Adults | Rationale |
|------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Barbell squat | Chair squat (sit-to-stand) or goblet squat | Balance safety, functional pattern |
| Deadlift | Dumbbell RDL with light weight | Lower injury risk, grip often limiting |
| Push-up | Wall push-up → incline push-up → kneeling | Progressive difficulty |
| Lunge | Supported lunge (holding chair/wall) | Balance assist |
| Plank | Incline plank (hands on elevated surface) | Reduces wrist/shoulder strain |
| Running | Brisk walking or water walking | Joint-friendly cardio |

### Balance Training Protocol

Perform daily or ≥3×/week, 10-15 min:
1. Single-leg stand — 10-30 sec each side (near a wall for safety)
2. Tandem stance (heel to toe) — 10-30 sec
3. Heel-to-toe walking — 10 steps
4. Sit-to-stand without hands — ×5-10
5. Weight shifts side to side — ×10
6. Turn in place (360°) — ×3 each direction

Progress by: closing eyes, standing on foam pad, adding head turns.

### Safety Notes

- Always have a stable support (chair, wall) nearby during balance exercises
- Avoid breath-holding (Valsalva) during resistance exercises — increases blood pressure
- Warm up longer (8-10 min) as joint stiffness is common
- Medication interactions: beta-blockers affect HR (use RPE, not HR zones); diuretics increase dehydration risk; statins may cause muscle soreness
- Blood pressure: avoid heavy isometric holds and overhead exercises if hypertension is uncontrolled

## 2. Pregnancy & Postpartum

### ACOG 2020 Guidelines (Committee Opinion No. 804)

**Key position**: Physical activity during pregnancy is safe and beneficial for most women. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-conditioning exercises before, during, and after pregnancy.

### During Pregnancy

**Recommendation**: ≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, swimming, stationary cycling). Strength training with moderate loads is also safe.

**Absolute contraindications to exercise** (ACOG list — DO NOT program exercise, refer to OB/GYN):
- Incompetent cervix / cerclage
- Multiple gestation at risk for premature labor
- Persistent 2nd/3rd trimester bleeding
- Placenta previa after 26 weeks
- Premature labor during current pregnancy
- Ruptured membranes
- Preeclampsia / pregnancy-induced hypertension
- Severe anemia

**Relative contraindications** (exercise with medical guidance):
- Mild/moderate cardiovascular or respiratory disorder
- Anemia (Hb < 10)
- Extreme underweight (BMI < 12)
- History of extremely sedentary lifestyle
- Poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease, or seizure disorder

### Trimester-Specific Modifications

| Trimester | Modifications |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1st (weeks 1-12) | Often feel fatigued/nauseous — reduce intensity if needed. Most exercises are fine. Avoid overheating (stay hydrated, skip hot yoga). |
| 2nd (weeks 13-27) | **Avoid supine (lying flat on back) exercises after ~20 weeks** — the uterus can compress the vena cava, reducing blood flow. Use incline or side-lying alternatives. Adjust balance exercises as center of gravity shifts. |
| 3rd (weeks 28-40) | Reduce impact. Prefer walking, swimming, stationary bike. Reduce range of motion if joints feel unstable (relaxin hormone increases joint laxity). Stop if any pain, bleeding, contractions, or fluid leakage. |

**Exercises to AVOID during pregnancy**:
- Contact/collision sports
- Activities with high fall risk (skiing, horseback riding, ice skating)
- Hot yoga / hot Pilates (hyperthermia risk)
- Scuba diving
- Heavy Valsalva maneuvers
- Supine exercises after ~20 weeks (modify to incline)
- Exercises causing abdominal coning/doming (sign of diastasis recti)

**Safe & Recommended exercises**:
- Walking, swimming, stationary cycling
- Modified strength training (lighter loads, higher reps, avoid supine)
- Prenatal yoga (specific prenatal classes/videos recommended)
- Pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) — consult a pelvic floor physio if uncertain
- Bird dogs, side planks, pallof press (core safe alternatives to crunches)

### Postpartum Return to Exercise

- **ACOG**: Women can return to exercise gradually as soon as medically safe, often within days of uncomplicated vaginal delivery
- **C-section**: Typically wait 6-8 weeks before resuming exercise beyond walking. Follow OB/GYN guidance.
- **Diastasis recti**: Common (affects up to 60% of postpartum women). Avoid traditional crunches/sit-ups. Focus on deep core retraining: diaphragmatic breathing, pelvic floor work, modified dead bugs. Refer to pelvic floor physiotherapist for assessment.
- **Pelvic floor**: Urinary leakage during exercise is common but NOT normal long-term. Refer to pelvic floor PT.
- **Breastfeeding**: Exercise does not affect milk supply or composition. Hydrate well. May be more comfortable to feed/pump before exercise.
- **Gradual progression**: Start at 50% of pre-pregnancy fitness level and build back over 8-12 weeks.

## 3. Youth & Adolescents (6-17)

### WHO 2020 / NSCA Guidelines

- **Aerobic**: ≥60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mostly aerobic)
- **Strength**: Muscle-strengthening activities ≥3 days/week
- **Bone-strengthening**: Weight-bearing/impact activities ≥3 days/week (running, jumping, sports)

### Resistance Training for Youth (NSCA Position Statement, 2009/updated)

**Key evidence-based positions**:
- Resistance training IS safe and beneficial for children and adolescents when properly supervised and age-appropriate
- It does NOT stunt growth — this is a persistent myth. Properly designed programs do not damage growth plates.
- Focus on movement quality, not load. RPE or "effort" is more appropriate than %1RM.
- 1RM testing is generally avoided for prepubescent children; use rep-based assessments

**Programming for youth:**

| Age Group | Focus | Sets × Reps | Progression |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 6-9 | Fundamental movement skills: running, jumping, throwing, climbing. Bodyweight exercises. Make it fun. | 1-2 × 10-15 | Increase coordination, not load |
| 10-13 | Introduce structured resistance training with bodyweight + light external load. Sport-specific skills. | 2-3 × 10-15 | Gradually add light resistance |
| 14-17 | Can use structured resistance programs similar to adults. Emphasize technique. | 2-4 × 6-15 | Progressive overload with good form |

**Safety for youth**:
- ALWAYS supervise
- No maximal or near-maximal lifts until skeletal maturity (~16+ with training experience)
- Avoid sport specialization before age 15 — diversify activities (WHO, ACSM)
- Hydration is critical — children are less efficient thermoregulators

## 4. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)

### Key Principles

- **Joint-friendly first**: Excess body weight increases joint stress. Prioritize low-impact activities: walking, cycling, swimming, elliptical.
- **Start conservatively**: Many obese individuals have low cardiorespiratory fitness. Even 5-10 min of activity is beneficial initially.
- **Seated/supported options**: Chair exercises, recumbent bike, aquatic exercise reduce musculoskeletal strain.
- **Non-weight-bearing cardio**: Swimming and cycling are excellent because body weight is supported.
- **Avoid shaming**: Language matters. Focus on what the body CAN do, not weight. Use inclusive cues.

### ACSM Recommendations for Overweight/Obese Adults

- **Aerobic**: Progress to 200-300 min/week moderate intensity for weight management (higher than general 150 min recommendation)
- **Strength**: 2-3×/week, all major muscle groups
- **Flexibility**: Daily stretching, focus on commonly restricted areas (hip flexors, hamstrings)

### Starting Protocol (Very Low Fitness)

| Week | Activity | Duration | Frequency |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Walking at comfortable pace | 10-15 min | Daily or near-daily |
| 3-4 | Walking, slightly increased pace | 15-20 min | 5-6×/week |
| 5-6 | Walking + 1× chair-based strength | 20-25 min walk + 15 min strength | Walk 5×, strength 1× |
| 7-8 | Walking + 2× bodyweight strength | 25-30 min walk + 20 min strength | Walk 5×, strength 2× |
| 9-12 | Progress to brisk walking / cycling / swimming | 30+ min cardio + 20-30 min strength | Cardio 4-5×, strength 2× |

### Exercise Selection Priorities

| Prefer | Avoid (initially) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Walking, cycling, swimming, elliptical | Running/jogging (high joint impact) |
| Seated resistance machines | Complex barbell movements (mobility may be limited) |
| Recumbent bike | Burpees, jump squats, box jumps |
| Aquatic exercise | Exercises requiring getting up/down from floor (unless accessible) |
| Incline push-ups, wall push-ups | Standard push-ups (wrist strain, difficulty) |

---

## 5. Type 2 Diabetes

### ADA / ACSM Guidelines (ADA Standards of Care 2024)

- **Aerobic**: ≥150 min/week moderate OR ≥75 min/week vigorous, spread over ≥3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity
- **Resistance**: 2-3×/week on non-consecutive days, moderate-to-vigorous intensity
- **Flexibility**: 2-3×/week
- **Reduce sedentary time**: Break up prolonged sitting every 30 minutes with light activity

### Blood Sugar Considerations

- Exercise generally LOWERS blood glucose. Risk of hypoglycemia during/after exercise, especially if on insulin or sulfonylureas.
- **Pre-exercise blood glucose check** (if on insulin/medication):
  - < 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dL): Eat a small carb snack before exercising
  - 5.0-13.9 mmol/L (90-250 mg/dL): Generally safe to exercise
  - > 13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) with ketones: Do NOT exercise
  - > 16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL): Caution, even without ketones
- **Post-exercise**: Blood glucose may continue to drop for hours. Monitor and have fast-acting carbs available.
- Instruct user to carry glucose tablets or a sugary drink during exercise

### Programming Notes

- A combination of aerobic + resistance training has the greatest effect on HbA1c reduction (Church et al., 2010)
- Post-meal walking (10-15 min after meals) is one of the most effective interventions for blood glucose management
- Avoid exercise during peak insulin action periods
- Foot care: Proper footwear is critical due to peripheral neuropathy risk. Inspect feet before/after exercise.

## 6. Hypertension

### ACSM / AHA Guidelines

- Exercise is a first-line treatment for elevated blood pressure (alongside medication/lifestyle)
- **Aerobic**: 5-7 days/week, 30-60 min/session, moderate intensity. Expected reduction: 5-8 mmHg systolic.
- **Resistance**: 2-3 days/week, moderate intensity (50-70% 1RM), 8-12 reps. Avoid heavy isometric holds and Valsalva maneuver.
- **Avoid**: Heavy lifting with breath-holding, exercises causing straining

### Programming Modifications

- Emphasize aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, swimming)
- Resistance training: Use lighter loads, higher reps, breathe continuously
- Avoid: Overhead pressing with heavy loads, heavy deadlifts, Valsalva
- Cool down gradually — sudden cessation can cause blood pressure drops
- Medication note: Beta-blockers lower HR; use RPE rather than HR zones
- Uncontrolled hypertension (>180/110): Do NOT exercise. Refer to physician.

## 7. Osteoporosis & Osteopenia

### NOF / ACSM Guidelines

- **Weight-bearing aerobic exercise**: Walking, stair climbing, dancing (NOT swimming or cycling — these are non-weight-bearing and do not stimulate bone)
- **Resistance training**: 2-3×/week, targeting major muscle groups, especially hips and spine. Moderate-to-high intensity resistance training is more effective for bone than light weights (ACSM 2022).
- **Balance training**: Critical to prevent falls (falls + osteoporosis = fractures)

### Key Dos and Don'ts

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Weight-bearing cardio (walking, stairs, dancing) | High-impact activities if severe osteoporosis (running, jumping) |
| Resistance training with progressive overload | Spinal flexion under load (weighted crunches, heavy bent-over rows) |
| Back extensions (prone, gentle) | Deep forward bending with resistance |
| Balance training (single-leg stands, Tai Chi) | Explosive movements if bone density is very low |
| Standing exercises (more bone-stimulating) | Primarily seated/lying programs |

### Bone-Specific Exercise Protocol

- **Spine**: Prone back extensions, bird dogs, seated rows with upright torso
- **Hip**: Standing hip abduction, step-ups, squats/lunges, weight-bearing walking
- **Wrist**: Grip training, modified push-ups (if tolerated)
- **Balance**: Daily, 10-15 min — see Older Adults section

## 8. Arthritis (Osteoarthritis & Rheumatoid)

### ACSM / ACR Guidelines

**Key position**: Exercise is recommended for all forms of arthritis. It reduces pain, improves function, and does NOT accelerate joint damage when appropriately dosed (Fransen et al., 2015 Cochrane review for OA).

### Programming Principles

- **Low-impact aerobic**: Walking, cycling, swimming, water aerobics. Avoid high-impact if joints are inflamed.
- **Resistance training**: 2-3×/week, moderate intensity. Strengthening muscles around affected joints reduces pain and improves stability.
- **ROM / flexibility**: Daily gentle ROM exercises to maintain joint mobility.
- **Aquatic exercise**: Excellent for arthritis — buoyancy reduces joint load by up to 90%. Water temperature 28-31°C is ideal.

### Flare Management

- During acute flares (hot, swollen joints): Reduce intensity and volume significantly. Gentle ROM exercises and walking are usually still safe. Avoid loading the inflamed joint.
- Between flares: Train normally with appropriate modifications.
- RA-specific: Morning stiffness is common — schedule exercise for later in the day when stiffness has eased.

---

## 9. Chronic Low Back Pain

### Evidence-Based Approach (NICE 2020, ACSM)

- Exercise is the MOST recommended non-pharmacological treatment for chronic low back pain
- **No single exercise type is clearly superior** — walking, Pilates, yoga, strength training, and aquatic exercise all show benefit
- Movement is medicine: Avoiding activity due to fear of pain (kinesiophobia) worsens outcomes

### Recommended Exercises

- **McGill Big 3** (Stuart McGill protocol, well-supported):
  1. Modified Curl-Up — 10 sec hold × 6-8 reps
  2. Side Plank — 10 sec hold × 4-6 each side
  3. Bird Dog — 10 sec hold × 6-8 each side
- **Glute bridges**: Activate glutes, stabilize pelvis
- **Cat-Cow**: Gentle spinal mobility
- **Walking**: Consistently shown to reduce LBP
- **Swimming/aquatic exercise**: Reduced spinal loading
- **Pilates**: Strong evidence for chronic LBP (Wells et al., 2014 Cochrane)

### Exercises to Approach with Caution

- Heavy conventional deadlifts (substitute: hip thrust, cable pull-through)
- Sit-ups / crunches (substitute: McGill curl-up, dead bugs)
- Seated toe-touch stretches with heavy rounding
- Heavy barbell good mornings
- Note: These aren't universally contraindicated, but should be introduced cautiously and only when pain-free ROM allows

## 10. Asthma & Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

### GINA / ACSM Guidelines

- Exercise is safe and recommended for people with asthma. Well-controlled asthma should not limit physical activity.
- EIB (formerly "exercise-induced asthma") affects 40-90% of asthmatics and ~10% of general population.

### Programming Modifications

- **Warm-up is critical**: A gradual 10-15 min warm-up can significantly reduce EIB symptoms (refractory period effect)
- **Prefer**: Warm, humid environments over cold, dry air (indoor pool is ideal)
- **Interval exercise** may be better tolerated than continuous (shorter bouts of activity)
- **Cool down gradually** — don't stop suddenly
- **Medication**: User should have rescue inhaler accessible during exercise. Pre-exercise bronchodilator use (per physician) can prevent EIB.
- **Avoid triggers**: Cold air, high pollution days, recently mowed grass, chlorinated pools (for some individuals)
- **Swimming** is often the best-tolerated cardio for asthmatics (warm, humid air)

## 11. General Medical Clearance Guidance

### When to Recommend Medical Clearance Before Programming

The ACSM uses the pre-participation screening algorithm (ACSM 2022):

**Always recommend medical clearance if the user reports**:
- Known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease
- Signs/symptoms: chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, dizziness/syncope, ankle edema, palpitations
- Currently sedentary AND planning to begin vigorous exercise (not needed for moderate exercise in asymptomatic individuals per ACSM 2022 — this was a significant update from older guidelines)

**Does NOT need clearance** (can start moderate exercise):
- Currently sedentary but asymptomatic with no known disease → start moderate exercise, progress gradually
- Currently active and asymptomatic → can continue and progress

### How to Phrase It

When medical clearance is needed, say:
> "建议在开始之前先咨询你的医生，确认这个训练计划适合你的情况。把这个计划带给医生看，让他们帮你评估一下。"

Do NOT say "you need a doctor's permission" (too paternalistic) or "you might die if you exercise" (fear-inducing). Frame it as a smart, collaborative step.
