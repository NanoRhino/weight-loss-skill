# Cardio & Endurance Programming Guide

This reference covers program design for cardio-dominant goals: running, cycling, swimming, general aerobic fitness, and endurance event preparation. Read this when the user's primary goal is NOT strength/hypertrophy but rather cardiovascular fitness, endurance performance, or fat loss via cardio-dominant approaches.

Reference standards: ACSM Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (11th ed., 2022), WHO Physical Activity Guidelines (2020), American Heart Association recommendations, and current peer-reviewed consensus.

## 1. Running Programs

### Foundational Principles

- **10% Rule**: Do not increase weekly running volume (distance or time) by more than 10% per week. This is the most established injury prevention guideline in running (supported by systematic reviews, though individual variation exists).
- **80/20 Rule**: Approximately 80% of running should be at easy/conversational pace; only 20% at moderate-to-hard intensity. This is well-supported by research on polarized training (Seiler, 2010; Stöggl & Sperlich, 2015).
- **Talk Test**: The simplest intensity gauge — if you can speak in full sentences, you're at the right easy pace.
- **Never run consecutive days** for beginners (first 8 weeks). Intermediate runners can run consecutive days if total weekly volume is managed.
- **Running surface**: Softer surfaces (trails, grass, track) reduce impact vs. concrete. Vary surfaces when possible.

### Couch to 5K (12 weeks)

Target: Someone who currently does not run. Goal: complete 5K (continuous or run/walk).

| Week | Run/Walk Ratio | Sessions/Week | Weekly Running Time |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | Run 1 min / Walk 2 min × 8 rounds | 3 | ~24 min running |
| 3-4 | Run 2 min / Walk 1.5 min × 7 rounds | 3 | ~42 min running |
| 5-6 | Run 3 min / Walk 1 min × 6 rounds | 3 | ~54 min running |
| 7-8 | Run 5 min / Walk 1 min × 5 rounds | 3 | ~75 min running |
| 9-10 | Continuous run 20 min | 3 | ~60 min running |
| 11 | Continuous run 25-30 min | 3 | ~75-90 min running |
| 12 | Easy week: 2 × easy 15 min + 5K attempt | 3 | Race week |

### 5K to 10K (8 weeks)

Prerequisite: Can run 5K continuously.

| Week | Long Run | Weekday Runs (2×) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| 1-2 | 5K easy | 3K easy + 3K with 4×1min pickups | Build base |
| 3-4 | 6K easy | 3.5K easy + 4K with 5×1min pickups | +10% volume |
| 5-6 | 7-8K easy | 4K easy + 4K tempo (middle 2K at comfortably hard) | Introduce tempo |
| 7 | 9K easy | 4K easy + 3K easy | Near-race distance |
| 8 | Easy 3K + 10K race | 3K easy + rest | Taper week |

### 10K to Half Marathon (12 weeks)

Prerequisite: Can run 10K. Runs 3-4× per week.

Key session types:
- **Easy run**: Conversational pace, 65-75% max HR
- **Tempo run**: "Comfortably hard," 80-85% max HR, sustainable for 20-40 min
- **Long run**: Easy pace, longest run of the week, builds endurance
- **Intervals**: 400m-1600m repeats at 5K pace with recovery jogs

| Week | Long Run | Key Workout | Easy Runs | Total Volume |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | 12-14K | Tempo 3K | 2 × 5-6K | 28-32K/week |
| 4-6 | 15-17K | Tempo 4K or 6×800m intervals | 2 × 6K | 33-38K/week |
| 7-9 | 18-20K | Tempo 5K or 5×1K intervals | 2 × 6-7K | 38-42K/week |
| 10-11 | 21K (peak) then 16K | Reduced intensity | 2 × 5K | Taper begins |
| 12 | Half Marathon | Easy 3K only | Rest | Race week |

## 2. Cycling Programs

### Beginner Cycling (8 weeks to comfortable 30K ride)

| Week | Ride Duration | Intensity | Frequency |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 20-25 min | Easy (can talk freely) | 3×/week |
| 3-4 | 30-35 min | Easy, include gentle hills | 3×/week |
| 5-6 | 40-45 min | Easy, 2 × 3-min moderate pushes | 3×/week |
| 7-8 | 50-60 min | Easy base + 1 session with intervals | 3×/week |

### Cycling for Fitness (ongoing)

Weekly structure for someone cycling 3-4× per week:
- **2× easy rides**: 45-60 min, conversational pace, Zone 2
- **1× interval ride**: 30-40 min total, including 6-8 × 1-min hard / 2-min easy
- **1× long ride (weekend)**: 60-90 min, easy to moderate pace

### Indoor vs. Outdoor

Indoor cycling (trainer/spin bike) is ~20% more time-efficient due to no coasting. A 45-min indoor ride ≈ 60-min outdoor ride in training stimulus. Adjust prescribed times accordingly.

---

## 3. Swimming Programs

### Beginner Swimming (can swim but not continuously)

Key: Rest between laps is expected and encouraged. Use pool lengths (25m standard).

| Week | Total Distance | Structure | Frequency |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 400-500m | 25m swim / 30 sec rest × 16-20 | 2-3×/week |
| 3-4 | 600-800m | 50m swim / 20 sec rest × 12-16 | 2-3×/week |
| 5-6 | 800-1000m | 100m swim / 15 sec rest × 8-10 | 2-3×/week |
| 7-8 | 1000-1200m | 200m swim / 15 sec rest × 5-6 | 2-3×/week |

### Intermediate Swimming (can swim 1000m+ continuously)

Weekly structure:
- **2× technique-focused**: Drills + moderate distance (e.g., 1500m with drill sets)
- **1× endurance**: Continuous 2000-3000m at easy pace
- **1× interval**: Sprint sets (e.g., 10 × 50m hard / 20 sec rest)

### Stroke Efficiency Note

For beginners, improving technique yields more speed gains than fitness. Recommend watching Total Immersion or Effortless Swimming videos. A single swim lesson can dramatically improve efficiency and reduce injury risk.

## 4. General Aerobic Fitness

Based on WHO 2020 and ACSM 2022 guidelines:

### Minimum Recommendations (all healthy adults)

- **150-300 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity**, OR
- **75-150 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity**, OR
- An equivalent combination
- **Plus 2× per week muscle-strengthening activities** involving all major muscle groups

### Designing a General Fitness Program

For users who say "I just want to be healthy" or "improve overall fitness":

| Day Type | Content | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Moderate cardio | Brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing — can hold conversation | 3-5×/week, 30-60 min |
| Vigorous cardio | Running, HIIT, fast cycling, vigorous swimming | 1-2×/week, 20-30 min |
| Strength | Bodyweight or resistance training, all major muscle groups | 2×/week, 20-30 min |
| Flexibility | Stretching, yoga, mobility work | 2-3×/week, 10-15 min |

### Sedentary / Very Low Fitness Starting Point

For users who are currently sedentary (e.g., stair test = "very winded, can't speak"):

**Weeks 1-4**: Walking only
- Start: 10 min/day, comfortable pace
- Build: Add 2-3 min/week
- Goal: 30 min continuous walking by Week 4

**Weeks 5-8**: Walking + light activity
- Walking: 30 min, 4-5×/week, gradually increase pace
- Add: 1-2× gentle bodyweight exercises (chair squats, wall push-ups, glute bridges)
- Add: 1× flexibility session (10 min stretching)

**Weeks 9-12**: Transition to full program
- Walking becomes brisk walking or light jogging intervals
- Bodyweight training becomes structured (3 sets per exercise)
- Can introduce swimming, cycling, or other preferred activities

## 5. HIIT Programming

### When to Use HIIT

HIIT is appropriate when:
- User has at least 4-6 weeks of regular moderate exercise as a base
- No contraindicated conditions (uncontrolled hypertension, recent cardiac events, acute injuries)
- User is interested in time-efficient training
- Goal includes fat loss, VO2max improvement, or sport performance

HIIT is NOT appropriate when:
- Complete beginner with no exercise base (build aerobic base first)
- User's stair test indicates "noticeably winded" or worse
- User explicitly dislikes high intensity
- Active injury that could worsen with impact

### HIIT Protocols (evidence-based)

**Tabata Protocol** (Tabata et al., 1996)
- 20 sec all-out / 10 sec rest × 8 rounds = 4 min
- Extremely demanding. Only for well-conditioned individuals.
- Typically done on a bike; running version has higher injury risk.

**Norwegian 4×4 Protocol** (Wisløff et al., 2007)
- 4 min at 85-95% max HR / 3 min active recovery × 4 rounds
- Total: ~25 min. Well-studied for cardiovascular health improvement.
- Suitable for intermediate exercisers.

**Sprint Interval Training (SIT)**
- 30 sec all-out / 4 min easy × 4-6 rounds
- Total: ~20-30 min including warm-up/cooldown.
- Significant VO2max gains in short time (Burgomaster et al., 2008).

**Beginner HIIT** (recommended starting point)
- 30 sec moderate-hard / 90 sec easy × 6-8 rounds
- Total: ~15-20 min. Build to harder protocols over 4-6 weeks.

### HIIT Frequency

- Maximum: 2-3× per week with at least 48 hours between sessions
- HIIT replaces, not supplements, other high-intensity work
- Always include easy aerobic sessions between HIIT days

## 6. Cardio for Fat Loss

### Evidence-Based Principles

- **Caloric deficit is primary**: Exercise alone (without dietary changes) produces modest fat loss (~1-3 kg over 6 months per systematic reviews). Exercise + diet is significantly more effective.
- **LISS vs. HIIT**: Both are effective for fat loss when caloric expenditure is matched. HIIT is more time-efficient. LISS is more sustainable and has lower injury/dropout risk. Recommend LISS-dominant approach with optional HIIT.
- **EPOC ("afterburn effect")**: Real but small. HIIT does burn slightly more calories post-exercise, but the difference is ~50-80 kcal, not the dramatic amounts sometimes claimed.
- **Muscle preservation**: Combining resistance training with cardio is critical during fat loss to preserve lean mass (supported by extensive meta-analyses).

### Fat Loss Cardio Prescription

| Component | Prescription | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| LISS | 3-4×/week, 30-40 min | Walking, cycling, elliptical. Sustainable, low injury risk |
| HIIT (optional) | 1-2×/week, 15-20 min | Only if user has aerobic base and tolerates intensity |
| NEAT | Increase daily movement | Steps target: 7,000-10,000/day (WHO/AHA guidelines support general physical activity) |
| Resistance training | 2-3×/week | Critical for muscle preservation. See strength programming guide |

## 7. Heart Rate Zone Training

### Zone Definitions (based on % of Max HR)

Estimate max HR: **220 − age** (simple) or **208 − 0.7 × age** (Tanaka formula, slightly more accurate for older adults per Tanaka et al., 2001).

| Zone | % Max HR | Feel | Use |
|------|----------|------|-----|
| Zone 1 | 50-60% | Very easy, can sing | Warm-up, active recovery |
| Zone 2 | 60-70% | Easy, can speak in full sentences | Base building, fat metabolism, long runs |
| Zone 3 | 70-80% | Moderate, can speak in short sentences | Tempo runs, moderate endurance |
| Zone 4 | 80-90% | Hard, a few words at a time | Threshold training, race pace |
| Zone 5 | 90-100% | All-out, can't speak | Sprints, max intervals |

### Zone Prescription by Goal

| Goal | Primary Zones | Typical Split |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| General health | Z1-Z2 | 100% easy |
| Fat loss | Z2 + occasional Z4 | 80% Z2, 20% Z4 |
| 5K/10K performance | Z2 base + Z4 intervals | 80% Z2, 10% Z3, 10% Z4-5 |
| Half/Full marathon | Z2 heavy + tempo Z3 | 80% Z2, 15% Z3, 5% Z4 |

### When NOT to Use HR Zones

- User doesn't have a HR monitor → use Talk Test or RPE instead
- User is on beta-blockers or other HR-affecting medications → HR zones are unreliable, use RPE
- Very hot/humid conditions → HR drifts up, use perceived effort instead

## 8. Common Endurance Injuries & Prevention

### Running Injuries

| Injury | Symptoms | Cause | Prevention |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Shin splints (Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome) | Pain along inner shin | Too much volume too fast, hard surfaces, worn shoes | 10% rule, calf strengthening (raises), proper shoes, vary surfaces |
| Runner's knee (Patellofemoral Pain) | Pain around/behind kneecap, worse going downhill/stairs | Weak quads/glutes, overpronation, sudden volume increase | Quad/glute strengthening, hip stability work, gradual progression |
| IT Band Syndrome | Pain on outer knee | Weak hip abductors, tight IT band, excessive downhill | Hip strengthening (clamshells, side-lying leg raises), foam rolling |
| Plantar fasciitis | Heel/arch pain, worst in morning | Tight calves, weak foot muscles, sudden volume increase | Calf stretching, foot strengthening (towel scrunches), proper shoes |
| Achilles tendinopathy | Pain in Achilles tendon | Sudden increase in speed work, tight calves, weak calves | Eccentric calf raises (Alfredson protocol), gradual speed work introduction |

### General Prevention Protocol for Runners

Include these in every running program:
1. **Calf raises**: 3×15, after every run
2. **Hip strengthening**: Clamshells, side-lying leg raises, 2×/week
3. **Glute activation**: Glute bridges before runs
4. **Foam rolling**: Calves, quads, IT band — 2-3×/week, 30-60 sec per area
5. **Proper footwear**: Replace running shoes every 500-800 km

### When to Stop and Seek Medical Help

Instruct the user to stop the activity and consult a healthcare professional if:
- Sharp or acute pain (not gradual muscle soreness)
- Pain that worsens during activity and doesn't improve with rest
- Swelling, redness, or warmth around a joint
- Pain that persists for more than 7 days despite rest
- Any chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath disproportionate to effort

## 9. Additional Cardio Modalities

### Structured Walking Program

For users where walking is the primary or only viable cardio option (sedentary, obese, older adults, rehabilitation).

| Week | Duration | Pace | Frequency |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 10-15 min | Comfortable, can sing | Daily or near-daily |
| 3-4 | 15-20 min | Comfortable to brisk | 5-6×/week |
| 5-6 | 20-25 min | Brisk (can talk but not sing) | 5-6×/week |
| 7-8 | 25-30 min | Brisk | 5-6×/week |
| 9-12 | 30-45 min | Brisk, add incline or stairs | 5-7×/week |

Walking is NOT inferior exercise. Brisk walking at >5.5 km/h provides moderate-intensity cardiovascular benefit (ACSM classification) and is the most sustainable long-term activity for most adults.

### Jump Rope

Excellent time-efficient cardio. Very high impact — not for beginners, people with joint issues, or significantly overweight individuals.

**Beginner jump rope protocol** (already has basic fitness):
- Week 1-2: 20 sec jump / 40 sec rest × 10 rounds (~10 min)
- Week 3-4: 30 sec jump / 30 sec rest × 10 rounds
- Week 5-6: 45 sec jump / 15 sec rest × 10 rounds
- Week 7+: Continuous 2-3 min blocks with 1 min rest × 3-5 rounds

**Approximate caloric expenditure**: ~10-16 kcal/min (high for a bodyweight activity).

### Rowing (Ergometer / Machine)

Full-body cardio — legs provide ~60% of power, core ~30%, arms ~10%.

**Beginner rowing (8 weeks)**:
- Week 1-2: 10 min easy, focus on technique (drive with legs first, then lean back, then pull arms)
- Week 3-4: 15 min steady state, stroke rate 18-22 spm
- Week 5-6: 20 min with 3 × 1-min harder pushes
- Week 7-8: 25 min with interval option (1 min hard / 2 min easy × 5)

**Key technique cue**: The most common beginner mistake is pulling with arms first. Correct sequence: Legs push → body swings back → arms pull. Reverse on the return.

### Stair Climbing

Excellent for lower body conditioning and cardiovascular fitness. Higher intensity than flat walking.

**Programming**:
- Beginner: 5-10 min continuous stair climbing (use handrail if needed), 2-3×/week
- Intermediate: 15-20 min, add intervals (1 flight fast / 1 flight normal)
- Advanced: 20-30 min, weighted (backpack), skip steps for more glute/quad work

**Descending stairs** places eccentric load on quads — this is a feature (builds strength) but can cause soreness for beginners. Walk down slowly or take the elevator down initially.

**Stair machine vs. real stairs**: Real stairs require more balance and ankle stability. Stair machines are lower impact and allow sustained effort. Both are effective.
