# Sport-Specific & Activity Preparation Guide

This reference covers conditioning programs for specific sports and recreational activities. Read this when the user wants to train FOR a sport or activity (not just general fitness).

Principle: Sport-specific training follows the **SAID principle** (Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands). Train the energy systems, movement patterns, and physical qualities that the sport requires.

## 1. Sport Analysis Framework

Before designing a sport-specific program, analyze the sport across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|----------|
| **Energy system** | Aerobic-dominant, anaerobic, or mixed? Continuous or intermittent? |
| **Movement patterns** | Linear, lateral, rotational? Which planes of motion? |
| **Physical qualities** | Strength, power, speed, agility, endurance, flexibility? Rank priority. |
| **Common injuries** | What joints/tissues are most at risk? What prevents them? |
| **Duration** | How long is a game/match/event? What's the work-to-rest ratio? |

## 2. Ball Sports

### Basketball / Soccer (Intermittent High-Intensity)

**Sport analysis**: Intermittent sprints + jogging + direction changes. Requires: aerobic base, repeated sprint ability, lower body power, agility, single-leg stability.

**Weekly structure (in-season support, 2-3 gym sessions)**:

| Focus | Key Exercises | Sets × Reps |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Lower body power | Jump squats, box jumps, trap bar deadlift | 3-4 × 3-5 |
| Single-leg strength | Bulgarian split squats, single-leg RDL | 3 × 8-10 each |
| Agility | Lateral shuffles, cone drills, 5-10-5 shuttle | 4-6 × 10-20 sec |
| Core anti-rotation | Pallof press, cable chops | 3 × 10-12 |
| Conditioning | Repeated sprint: 20m × 6-8, walk back recovery | 2-3 sets |

**Injury prevention priorities**: ACL (especially female athletes — neuromuscular training, FIFA 11+ warm-up program reduces ACL injuries by ~50%, Thorborg et al. 2017), ankle sprains (balance + proprioception), hamstring strains (Nordic hamstring curls — evidence strongly supports these per van Dyk et al. 2019).

### Tennis / Badminton (Racquet Sports)

**Sport analysis**: Rotational power, lateral movement, shoulder endurance, grip strength. Intermittent high-intensity with rest between points.

**Key training emphases**:
- **Rotational power**: Med ball rotational throws, cable woodchops
- **Shoulder prehab**: External rotation (band), face pulls, serratus punches
- **Lateral agility**: Lateral shuffles, crossover steps, split-step drills
- **Grip/forearm**: Wrist curls, farmer's walks, rice bucket
- **Core**: Anti-rotation (Pallof press), rotational stability

**Common injuries**: Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) — eccentric wrist extension, gradual load management. Shoulder impingement — rotator cuff strengthening and thoracic mobility. Ankle sprains — proprioceptive training.

## 3. Combat Sports / Martial Arts

**Sport analysis**: Mixed energy systems (anaerobic bursts + aerobic recovery). Requires: total body power, grip strength, neck stability, hip flexibility, high work capacity.

**Weekly structure (3 martial arts sessions + 2-3 conditioning)**:

| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| S&C Day 1 | Lower body power: squats, deadlifts, box jumps |
| S&C Day 2 | Upper body + grip: pull-ups, push press, farmer's walks, rows |
| Conditioning | Intervals mimicking fight rounds: 3-5 min work / 1 min rest × 3-5 rounds |

**Key exercises by attribute**:
- **Takedown power**: Barbell hip thrust, trap bar deadlift, power clean
- **Clinch/grappling strength**: Pull-ups, rows, rope climbs, grip work
- **Striking power**: Med ball slams, rotational throws, push press
- **Neck**: Neck isometric holds (NOT weighted full ROM — injury risk), band neck exercises
- **Hip flexibility**: 90/90, deep squat holds, hip CARs

---

## 4. Rock Climbing & Bouldering

**Sport analysis**: Grip endurance, pulling strength, core tension, shoulder stability, hip flexibility. Body composition matters (strength-to-weight ratio).

**Climbing-specific training**:
- **Finger strength**: Hangboard training (NOT for beginners — tendon adaptation takes months). Begin with large edges, progress to smaller. Max 2-3× per week.
- **Pulling**: Weighted pull-ups, lock-offs (hold chin over bar 5 sec), one-arm hang progressions
- **Core tension**: Front lever progressions, hanging L-sits, ab wheel
- **Antagonist training** (critical for injury prevention): Push-ups, dips, external rotation, wrist extensions. Climbing is heavily pull-dominant — must balance with pushing.
- **Hip flexibility**: Deep squat holds, frog stretch, hip CARs

**Common injuries**: Pulley injuries (finger A2/A4), shoulder impingement, elbow tendinopathy. Prevention: gradual progression, antagonist training, proper warm-up (especially fingers), avoid crimping early.

---

## 5. Dance

**Sport analysis**: Flexibility, single-leg stability/strength, aesthetic control, cardiovascular endurance, rhythm. Injury often from hypermobility, repetitive impact, and poor eccentric control.

**Supplementary training for dancers**:
- **Single-leg strength**: Single-leg squats, single-leg deadlifts, relevé (calf raises) on one foot
- **Eccentric control**: Slow negative lunges, slow calf lowering (for jumps)
- **Core**: Pilates-based work (bridges, dead bugs, side planks) — Pilates originated for dancers
- **Cardiovascular**: Interval training mimicking dance performance (30 sec hard / 30 sec rest)
- **Turnout maintenance**: Clamshells, external rotation work, 90/90 mobility

**Note**: Many dancers are naturally flexible but may lack STABILITY at end range. Focus on strength in stretched positions, not more stretching.

---

## 6. Golf

**Sport analysis**: Rotational power, thoracic mobility, hip mobility, anti-extension core stability, single-leg balance. Low cardiovascular demand but high neuromuscular precision.

**Key training emphases**:
- **Thoracic rotation**: Seated rotations, open books, foam roller extensions
- **Hip mobility**: 90/90 switches, hip CARs, deep squat holds
- **Rotational power**: Med ball rotational throws, cable woodchops, landmine rotations
- **Core**: Anti-extension (dead bugs, ab wheel), anti-rotation (Pallof press)
- **Glute strength**: Hip thrusts, single-leg RDL (stability for the swing)

**Programming**: 2-3×/week, 30-40 min. Emphasize mobility warm-up before every round. Low back pain is the most common golf injury — McGill Big 3 as part of warm-up.

---

## 7. Hiking & Trekking Preparation

**Sport analysis**: Sustained low-intensity aerobic work, eccentric leg strength (especially downhill), load carriage, ankle stability.

**Preparation program (8 weeks before a multi-day trek)**:

| Week | Cardio | Strength (2×/week) | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1-2 | Walk 30-45 min on flat, 3×/week | Bodyweight squats, lunges, step-ups, calf raises | Build base |
| 3-4 | Walk 45-60 min with incline, 3×/week | Add weighted backpack (start 5 kg), increase reps | Simulate load |
| 5-6 | Walk 60-90 min with elevation changes | Increase pack weight (target: 60-70% of trek weight), add eccentric step-downs | Specificity |
| 7-8 | One long hike per week (3-5 hours) + 2 shorter walks | Maintain strength, reduce volume | Taper toward trek |

**Eccentric focus for downhill**:
- Slow step-downs from elevated platform ×10 each leg
- Walking lunges with slow descent (3 sec down)
- Nordic hamstring curls (if tolerated)

**Ankle stability**: Single-leg balance on uneven surfaces, ankle circles, lateral band walks.

## 8. Obstacle Course / Functional Fitness

**Sport analysis**: Mixed modality — strength, endurance, power, grip, carries, gymnastics movements. Requires broad general fitness.

**Weekly structure (4 days)**:

| Day | Focus | Key Exercises |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Strength — Upper | Pull-ups, overhead press, dips, rows |
| 2 | Conditioning | Running intervals + bodyweight circuit (burpees, box jumps, kettlebell swings) |
| 3 | Strength — Lower | Squats, deadlifts, lunges, farmer's walks |
| 4 | Mixed | 20-30 min AMRAP or EMOM combining strength + cardio elements |

**Key capacities to develop**: Grip (dead hangs, farmer's walks), pulling (rope climbs, pull-up volume), running endurance (2-5 km ability), upper body endurance (push-up capacity).

---

## 9. Rowing

**Sport analysis**: Aerobic + anaerobic power, posterior chain dominant (hamstrings, glutes, back), grip endurance. Highly repetitive pattern — injury risk from overuse and poor technique.

**Supplementary training for rowers**:
- **Posterior chain**: Deadlifts, RDLs, hip thrusts
- **Upper back**: Barbell rows, face pulls (counteract rounded position)
- **Core**: Dead bugs, Pallof press (rotational stability in the boat)
- **Shoulder prehab**: External rotation, band pull-aparts
- **Mobility**: Thoracic extension, hip flexor stretching (counteract compressed position)

**Common injuries**: Low back pain (#1), rib stress fractures (from repeated compression), wrist/forearm tendinopathy. Prevention: limit sudden volume spikes, ensure technique quality, strengthen core and posterior chain.

---

## 10. Skiing & Snowboarding Preparation

**Sport analysis**: Eccentric quad/glute endurance, balance, rotational control, cardiovascular endurance. High injury risk to knees (ACL) and shoulders.

**6-week pre-season protocol (3×/week)**:

**Strength & eccentric focus**:
- Wall sits: 3 × 30-60 sec (progress to single-leg)
- Goblet squat with slow descent (4 sec down): 3 × 10
- Lateral lunges: 3 × 10 each side
- Single-leg RDL: 3 × 8 each side
- Box jumps with controlled landing: 3 × 6

**Balance & proprioception**:
- Single-leg balance on unstable surface: 3 × 30 sec each
- Lateral hops (stick the landing): 3 × 6 each side
- BOSU ball squats (if available): 3 × 10

**Cardiovascular**:
- Cycling or stair climbing 30 min, 3×/week (quad endurance)
- Interval option: 30 sec hard / 30 sec rest × 10-15 rounds (simulates run duration)

**Key injury prevention**: ACL — neuromuscular training, hamstring strengthening, landing mechanics. Shoulder — rotator cuff work. Wrist (snowboarding) — consider wrist guards.
