# Mental Health, Chronic Conditions & Adaptive Exercise Guide

This reference covers exercise programming for mental health conditions, chronic complex illnesses, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and disability/adaptive exercise.

**Critical principle**: For all conditions in this file, the user should have physician clearance before starting. Claude's role is to provide evidence-based general guidance, not to diagnose or treat. Always recommend the user consult their healthcare team.

## 1. Exercise & Mental Health

### Evidence Base

Exercise has strong evidence as both treatment and prevention for depression and anxiety:

- **Depression**: Exercise has a large antidepressant effect (comparable to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for mild-to-moderate depression). Confirmed by multiple meta-analyses including Schuch et al. 2016 (Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews), Singh et al. 2023 (British Journal of Sports Medicine — the largest meta-analysis to date, 218 RCTs, found exercise is 1.5× more effective than counseling or leading medications).
- **Anxiety**: Moderate anxiolytic effect. Both aerobic and resistance training are effective. Stubbs et al. 2017 meta-analysis.
- **ADHD**: Emerging evidence that acute bouts of exercise improve executive function and attention (Cerrillo-Urbina et al. 2015). Chronic exercise may improve symptoms as adjunct to medication.
- **Dose-response**: The WHO-recommended 150 min/week of moderate activity provides most of the mental health benefit. However, **any amount is better than none** — even 10-15 min of walking shows measurable mood improvement.

### Programming Principles for Mental Health

1. **Adherence > optimization**: The best exercise is the one the user will actually do. Don't over-prescribe. A 15-min walk they do 5×/week is better than a 60-min gym session they skip.
2. **Start very small if motivation is low**: Depression saps energy and initiative. Start with "minimum viable doses" — a 5-min walk around the block, 3 bodyweight exercises in the bedroom. Expand gradually.
3. **Social component helps**: Group activities, walking with a friend, or classes have added social benefit. Offer this option.
4. **Outdoor exercise has additional benefit**: Nature exposure ("green exercise") has additive positive effects on mood. Suggest outdoor options when feasible (Barton & Pretty 2010).
5. **Don't tie exercise to body image goals**: For users with mental health challenges, frame exercise around how it makes them FEEL (energy, sleep, mood), not appearance. This is especially important given comorbidity of depression with disordered eating.
6. **Respect bad days**: If user says "I couldn't do the workout today" — validate, don't push. Suggest a smaller alternative ("Could you do a 5-min walk?") but accept if the answer is no.
7. **Both aerobic and resistance training are effective**: Don't default to "just go for a run." Resistance training shows comparable antidepressant effects (Gordon et al. 2018 meta-analysis).

### Suggested Starting Programs

**For someone with low energy/motivation (depression, burnout)**:

| Week | Target | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1-2 | Move for 10 min, 3×/week | Walk, gentle stretching, or any movement. Time of day doesn't matter. |
| 3-4 | 15-20 min, 3-4×/week | Add one more day, slightly longer. Can be different activities. |
| 5-6 | 20-30 min, 4-5×/week | Begin to include some structure — a bodyweight routine or a jog-walk |
| 7+ | Build toward WHO recommendations | 150 min/week moderate activity, include 2× strength if willing |

**For anxiety / stress reduction focus**:
- Yoga (especially slow-flow / restorative) — strong evidence for anxiety reduction (Cramer et al. 2018)
- Tai Chi — reduces anxiety and improves balance, especially in older adults (Wang et al. 2014)
- Walking in nature — 20-30 min, green spaces preferred
- Swimming — rhythmic, meditative quality
- Any rhythmic, repetitive aerobic activity at moderate intensity

### Mindful Movement Session Template (~25 min)

1. Diaphragmatic breathing — 2 min (inhale 4 sec, hold 2, exhale 6)
2. Gentle neck and shoulder rolls — 2 min
3. Cat-Cow — 1 min
4. Sun Salutation A (modified/gentle) — 3 rounds (~5 min)
5. Warrior I → Warrior II flow — 2 min each side
6. Seated forward fold — 1 min
7. Supine twist — 1 min each side
8. Legs up the wall — 3 min
9. Savasana with body scan — 5 min

### Red Flags — When to Recommend Professional Help

- User mentions suicidal thoughts or self-harm → Express care, provide crisis resources, do NOT just prescribe exercise
- User describes exercise as punishment or compulsion → May indicate disordered exercise (see nutrition-recovery-guide.md Section 7)
- User reports exercise consistently worsening mood or increasing anxiety → May need different approach or professional assessment
- Symptoms of severe depression not improving after 4-6 weeks of consistent exercise → Recommend speaking with a mental health professional

## 2. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) & Long COVID

### Critical Update: NICE 2021 Guidelines

**NICE 2021 (UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) made a major guideline change**: Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) is **no longer recommended** for ME/CFS. This reversed the previous 2007 NICE recommendation and reflects updated evidence that pushing through fatigue can cause Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) — a hallmark worsening of symptoms that can last days to weeks.

The US CDC has similarly updated their guidance to warn against exercise programs that do not respect PEM.

### Key Principles

1. **Pacing is paramount**: Activity must stay within the user's "energy envelope." If an activity causes symptom worsening 12-72 hours later (PEM), it was too much.
2. **No "pushing through"**: Unlike depression (where exercise almost always helps), ME/CFS and Long COVID require the opposite approach — doing LESS than you think you can.
3. **Heart rate capping (Workwell Foundation protocol)**: Some practitioners recommend staying below anaerobic threshold (often ~55-60% of age-predicted max HR, or lower based on individual testing). A heart rate monitor can help.
4. **Stabilize before progressing**: Maintain a stable baseline of activity for 2+ weeks without PEM before increasing anything.
5. **Cognitive activity counts**: Mental exertion also uses energy. Total load = physical + cognitive + emotional.

### What Claude Should Do

- **If user mentions ME/CFS, CFS, Long COVID, or post-viral fatigue** → Do NOT design a standard progressive exercise program
- Instead: Ask about current activity tolerance, PEM triggers, and whether they're working with a physician
- Suggest **gentle movement only**: 5-10 min seated stretching, very gentle walking (even 2-3 min), restorative yoga
- **Always recommend working with a physician or OT** experienced in ME/CFS
- Frame activity as "movement for comfort and mood" not "exercise for fitness"

### Gentle Activity Options (within energy envelope)

- Seated stretching (5-10 min)
- Very slow, short walks (2-5 min, with rests)
- Gentle tai chi (seated or standing)
- Restorative yoga (all lying/supported poses)
- Aquatic therapy (warm water, gentle movement — if tolerated)

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Prescribe any progressive overload
- ❌ Encourage "pushing through" fatigue
- ❌ Set distance/time targets
- ❌ Compare to depression exercise guidelines (different pathophysiology)
- ❌ Suggest the user is deconditioned and needs to build fitness (this framing is harmful for ME/CFS)

## 3. Cardiovascular Disease (Beyond Hypertension)

### Scope

Hypertension is covered in special-populations-guide.md. This section covers more complex CVD: post-cardiac event, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

### General Principles (ACSM/AHA 2020 Scientific Statement)

- Exercise is **strongly recommended** for most cardiovascular conditions — the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast majority of patients.
- Patients should have completed cardiac rehabilitation Phase I-II (supervised) before any unsupervised program.
- **Medical clearance is mandatory** — Claude should not design programs for CVD patients without confirmation of physician approval.

### Post-Cardiac Event (MI, CABG, PCI) — Phase III+ (Community-based)

If user has completed supervised cardiac rehab and has physician clearance:

- **Aerobic**: 3-5×/week, 20-60 min, moderate intensity (40-80% HRR or RPE 11-14 on Borg 6-20 scale)
- **Resistance**: 2-3×/week, 1-3 sets × 10-15 reps, light-to-moderate load, avoid Valsalva
- **Monitoring**: Stay below prescribed HR ceiling if one exists. Stop for: chest pain, excessive dyspnea, dizziness, irregular heartbeat
- **Progression**: Very gradual — increase duration before intensity. 5-10% per week maximum.

### Heart Failure (NYHA Classification)

| NYHA Class | Description | Exercise Guidance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| I | No symptoms with ordinary activity | Near-normal exercise capacity. Follow general guidelines with moderate intensity cap. |
| II | Slight limitation; comfortable at rest | Moderate aerobic 20-40 min, 3-5×/week. Light resistance OK. Monitor symptoms. |
| III | Marked limitation; comfortable only at rest | Short bouts (5-10 min) of low-intensity activity. Interval approach. Supervised preferred. |
| IV | Symptoms at rest | Exercise only under medical supervision. Bed-based range of motion may be appropriate. |

### Arrhythmias

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Moderate exercise is generally safe and beneficial. Avoid very high-intensity. Monitor HR.
- **Controlled with medication**: Follow physician's HR limits and activity restrictions.
- **ICD (Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) users**: Avoid activities with high risk of device impact. Stay below programmed HR threshold. Upper body ROM exercises important to prevent shoulder stiffness.

### What Claude Should Always Do for CVD Users

1. Confirm physician clearance before any programming
2. Ask about medications (beta-blockers affect HR response — don't use HR zones without adjusting)
3. Include explicit warning signs to stop: chest pain, unusual breathlessness, dizziness, palpitations, nausea
4. Program warm-ups of ≥10 min (gradual HR increase is critical)
5. Avoid isometric exercises at high intensity (blood pressure spike risk)

## 4. Cancer & Exercise

### ACSM 2019 Roundtable Guidelines (Campbell et al. 2019, Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise)

Exercise is safe and beneficial **during and after** cancer treatment. The ACSM roundtable concluded there is strong evidence that exercise:
- Reduces cancer-related fatigue (the #1 complaint)
- Improves physical function and quality of life
- May improve treatment completion rates
- Reduces risk of recurrence for breast, colon, and prostate cancers

### General Recommendations

- Follow WHO/ACSM standard guidelines (150 min/week moderate aerobic + 2× resistance) as the TARGET
- Most patients will need to START below these levels and progress gradually
- **Individualize based on**: treatment type, current side effects, fatigue level, fitness history

### During Active Treatment (Chemo, Radiation, Immunotherapy)

- **Expect fluctuation**: Energy levels vary dramatically day-to-day and with treatment cycles
- **Flexible programming**: "Do what you can" approach. Some days may be 5-min gentle walk, others 30-min normal session
- **Prioritize resistance training**: Helps counter treatment-related muscle wasting (sarcopenia), especially important during hormonal therapy
- **Low-to-moderate intensity**: RPE 3-5 on 0-10 scale during treatment, unless otherwise cleared
- **Avoid high intensity on treatment days** and 24-48 hours after chemo infusion
- **Hygiene**: If immunocompromised (low WBC), avoid public gyms during nadir period. Home exercise preferred.

### Survivorship (Post-treatment)

- Gradually return to full WHO guidelines
- Resistance training is especially important for:
  - Bone density (often compromised by hormonal treatments)
  - Countering treatment-related weight gain
  - Rebuilding muscle mass
- Address lingering fatigue — paradoxically, exercise REDUCES cancer-related fatigue (strong evidence)

### Lymphedema Considerations (Breast Cancer)

**Current evidence (per National Lymphedema Network and ACSM)**: Progressive resistance training is SAFE and does NOT increase lymphedema risk. This corrects the older advice to avoid upper body exercise.

- Start with very light weights and progress gradually
- Wear compression garment during exercise if prescribed
- Monitor the affected arm for swelling changes
- Stop if arm becomes significantly more swollen, painful, or red

### Red Flags — When to Hold Exercise

- Active bleeding or platelet count < 50,000/μL → no resistance training
- Fever > 38°C → rest
- Hemoglobin < 8 g/dL → reduce intensity significantly, walking only
- Bone metastases → avoid high-impact, heavy loading at affected sites
- Severe nausea/vomiting → rest, hydrate

## 5. Autoimmune & Inflammatory Conditions

### Fibromyalgia

**EULAR 2017 Revised Recommendations**: Exercise is the ONLY intervention that received a "strong" recommendation for fibromyalgia management (ahead of pharmacotherapy).

- **Aerobic exercise** has the strongest evidence: walking, cycling, swimming
- **Aquatic exercise** is particularly well-tolerated (warm water, buoyancy, reduced joint stress)
- **Start very low**: 5-10 min of gentle activity, 2-3×/week
- **Progress very slowly**: Add 1-2 min per week
- **Expect initial symptom increase**: Warn the user that the first 2-4 weeks may involve increased pain/fatigue, which typically improves with continued exercise
- **Intensity**: Low-to-moderate only. High intensity often triggers flares.
- Resistance training also beneficial but start with bodyweight only.

### Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

**ACSM/AAN (American Academy of Neurology) Guidelines**:
- Exercise is safe and beneficial for most people with MS
- Both aerobic and resistance training improve fatigue, walking ability, and quality of life
- **Heat sensitivity**: Many MS patients have Uhthoff phenomenon (heat worsens symptoms). Exercise in cool environments, use cooling vests, avoid hot yoga or outdoor exercise in heat.
- **Fatigue management**: Schedule exercise when energy is typically best (often morning for MS). Break sessions into shorter bouts if needed.
- **Balance training**: Important due to gait and balance impairments. Include single-leg stands, tandem walking.
- **Progression**: Slower than general population. Monitor for next-day symptom worsening.

### Lupus (SLE)

- Exercise is safe during remission periods. Reduce or stop during flares.
- Photosensitivity is common — avoid outdoor exercise in direct sunlight, or use UV protective clothing.
- Joint pain may limit exercise selection — choose low-impact options.
- Fatigue is a major barrier — same pacing principles as fibromyalgia.
- Aquatic exercise is often well-tolerated.

### General Flare Management Protocol (all autoimmune conditions)

| Flare Severity | Activity Recommendation |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Mild (symptoms present but manageable) | Reduce volume/intensity by 50%. Switch to gentle movement only (walking, stretching). |
| Moderate (significantly impaired) | Gentle stretching and ROM exercises only. 5-10 min. No resistance or cardio. |
| Severe (unable to perform normal daily activities) | Rest. Do not exercise. Focus on recovery. Return to activity only when flare subsides. |

After a flare: **Do NOT resume at pre-flare level**. Restart at 50% and rebuild over 2-4 weeks.

## 6. Disability & Adaptive Exercise

### Principles

- **Exercise guidelines apply to everyone**: WHO 2020 explicitly includes people with disabilities in the 150 min/week recommendation, adapted as needed.
- **Focus on ability, not limitation**: Ask what the user CAN do, what movements they enjoy, and what their goals are.
- **Adaptive equipment exists**: Resistance bands, wheelchair-accessible machines, hand cycles, seated ergometers.
- **Consult specialists**: For complex physical disabilities, recommend working with a physiotherapist or adaptive sport program for initial assessment.

### Wheelchair Users / Lower Limb Disability

**Aerobic options**:
- Hand cycle / arm ergometer — primary cardio option
- Wheelchair sports (basketball, tennis, racing)
- Swimming (with appropriate support/facility)
- Seated aerobic routines (arm-based)

**Strength options**:
- All upper body exercises translate directly (bench press, overhead press, rows, pull-ups/lat pulldowns, bicep/tricep work)
- Core: Modified planks (forearm plank on bench), seated rotations, Pallof press, medicine ball work
- Resistance bands: Versatile and accessible

**Sample Wheelchair User Weekly Plan (3 days)**:

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Mon | Upper body strength (push/pull, 4-5 exercises, 3×10-12) + Core |
| Wed | Arm ergometer 20-30 min moderate |
| Fri | Upper body strength (different exercises) + Shoulder mobility |

**Key considerations**:
- Shoulder health is critical — overuse injuries are very common in wheelchair users. Include rotator cuff prehab, scapular stability exercises.
- Avoid excessive overhead pressing volume.
- Stretch chest and anterior shoulders regularly (due to forward-leaning posture).

### Visual Impairment

- Provide exercise descriptions in precise verbal/textual detail (assume user may use screen reader)
- Avoid exercises that require visual balance cues without offering modifications (e.g., eyes-closed balance training is not appropriate for someone already visually impaired)
- Treadmill with safety clip > outdoor running on uneven terrain
- Group classes with an instructor who provides verbal cues > video-follow-along
- Resistance machines > free weights (fixed path of motion, safer)

### Hearing Impairment

- Standard exercise programming applies without significant modification
- Visual cues, written programs, and video demonstrations are ideal
- Group class environments may be difficult — provide written/visual programs they can follow independently
- No medical exercise contraindications related to hearing loss itself

### Amputees

- **Lower limb**: Seated or machine-based lower body work, single-leg exercises for intact limb, prosthetic-specific training with prosthetist guidance. Upper body and core exercises are largely unrestricted.
- **Upper limb**: Lower body exercises unrestricted. Adapt upper body to available grip/attachment. Many exercises can be done with wrist straps or adaptive grips.
- **Balance and proprioception**: Critical for lower limb amputees. Include balance training progressively.
- **Recommend**: Working with a physiotherapist experienced in amputee rehabilitation before independent programming.

### When to Refer Out

For all disability-related programming, Claude should recommend professional consultation if:
- User has a new or recent disability and hasn't yet worked with a physiotherapist
- User reports pain specifically related to their disability during exercise
- User has a complex disability affecting cardiorespiratory function (e.g., spinal cord injury above T6 — autonomic dysreflexia risk)
- User wants to compete in adaptive sport (refer to national adaptive sports organizations)
