# Nutrition, Recovery & Adherence Guide

This reference covers practical nutrition guidance, recovery principles, and evidence-based adherence strategies. This is NOT a diet plan — Claude should not prescribe specific diets. Instead, provide general evidence-based principles and recommend consulting a registered dietitian for personalized plans.

## 1. Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition

### Pre-Workout (1-3 hours before)

**Goal**: Provide fuel without GI discomfort.

| Timing | What to Eat | Examples |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 2-3 hours before | Balanced meal: carbs + protein + small amount of fat | Rice + chicken + vegetables; oatmeal + eggs; sandwich |
| 30-60 min before | Light, easily digestible carbs | Banana, toast with jam, small energy bar |
| <30 min before | Only if needed — very light | Few crackers, sports drink |

**Fasted training**: Evidence shows that training fasted does NOT improve fat loss compared to fed training when total daily calories are matched (Schoenfeld et al., 2014). If the user prefers fasted training and feels fine, it's acceptable. Don't recommend it as superior.

### Post-Workout (within 2 hours)

**Goal**: Initiate recovery — replenish glycogen, stimulate muscle protein synthesis.

- **Protein**: 20-40g (ISSN: 0.25-0.40 g/kg body weight) to maximize MPS
- **Carbs**: Important after endurance sessions or glycogen-depleting work. Ratio of ~3:1 carbs-to-protein for endurance athletes. Less critical timing for strength-only sessions.
- **"Anabolic window"**: The urgency of post-workout nutrition is overstated in popular media. Total daily protein intake matters MORE than precise timing (Schoenfeld et al., 2013 meta-analysis). However, eating within 2 hours post-workout is still a reasonable, practical recommendation.

### Daily Protein Targets (ISSN 2017 Position Stand)

| Goal | Protein (g/kg/day) |
|------|-------------------|
| General health / sedentary | 0.8 (RDA minimum) |
| Endurance athlete | 1.2-1.6 |
| Strength / hypertrophy | 1.6-2.2 |
| Fat loss (preserve muscle) | 1.6-2.4 (higher end during caloric deficit) |
| Older adults (65+) | 1.0-1.2 (higher than general population per PROT-AGE study group) |

## 2. Hydration

### ACSM / NATA Guidelines

- **Before exercise**: Drink 5-7 mL/kg body weight (350-500 mL for 70 kg person) at least 4 hours before
- **During exercise**: 150-350 mL every 15-20 min (adjust for sweat rate, temperature, humidity)
- **After exercise**: Replace ~150% of fluid lost (e.g., if you lost 1 kg during exercise, drink 1.5 L over the next few hours)

### Practical Signs of Dehydration

- Urine color: Aim for pale straw yellow. Dark yellow = drink more.
- Thirst: By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be mildly dehydrated
- Performance drop: Dehydration of >2% body mass impairs aerobic performance

### Electrolytes

- **When needed**: Exercise >60 min, heavy sweating, hot/humid conditions
- **What**: Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost in sweat (~500-1000 mg/L). Sports drinks or adding a pinch of salt to water is adequate for most people.
- **Not needed**: For sessions <60 min in temperate conditions, plain water is sufficient

## 3. Supplements (Evidence-Based Only)

**Principle**: Only mention supplements with strong, replicated evidence. Do NOT recommend supplements outside this list. Always note that whole food should be the primary nutritional strategy.

| Supplement | Evidence Level | Effective Dose | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| **Creatine monohydrate** | Very strong (ISSN: "most effective ergogenic supplement available") | 3-5 g/day (loading phase optional) | Improves strength, power, lean mass. Safe for long-term use. Does NOT cause kidney damage in healthy individuals (Antonio et al., 2021). |
| **Caffeine** | Very strong | 3-6 mg/kg, 30-60 min pre-exercise | Improves endurance, strength, power. Individual tolerance varies. Avoid late in day (sleep). |
| **Protein powder** | Strong (as a convenience food) | As needed to meet daily protein targets | Whey, casein, soy, pea all effective. Not superior to whole food protein. |
| **Vitamin D** | Moderate-strong for deficient individuals | Test levels; supplement if <30 ng/mL | Common deficiency, especially in northern latitudes. Important for bone health, muscle function, immunity. |

**NOT recommended / insufficient evidence for general population**: BCAAs (redundant if protein intake is adequate — ISSN 2017), fat burners, testosterone boosters, glutamine (for muscle growth), most pre-workout blends (beyond caffeine).

## 4. Sleep & Recovery

### Sleep Recommendations (National Sleep Foundation, ACSM)

| Age Group | Recommended Sleep |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Teenagers (14-17) | 8-10 hours |
| Adults (18-64) | 7-9 hours |
| Older Adults (65+) | 7-8 hours |

### Impact of Poor Sleep on Training

- Reduced strength and power output
- Impaired motor learning and skill acquisition
- Increased injury risk (1.7× increase with <7 hours, Milewski et al., 2014)
- Impaired glucose metabolism and increased appetite (relevant for fat loss goals)
- Reduced testosterone and growth hormone secretion

### Sleep Hygiene Recommendations

1. Consistent sleep/wake times (even on weekends)
2. Cool, dark, quiet room
3. No screens 30-60 min before bed (or use blue light filters)
4. Avoid caffeine after early afternoon
5. Avoid heavy meals 2-3 hours before bed
6. Exercise earlier in the day if evening exercise disrupts sleep (individual variation — some people sleep fine after evening exercise)

### Active Recovery

- **Light activity on rest days** (walking, easy cycling, swimming) promotes blood flow and may reduce DOMS
- **Foam rolling**: Modest evidence for reducing DOMS perception (Pearcey et al., 2015). Won't "break up scar tissue" but may reduce pain perception temporarily. 30-60 sec per muscle group.
- **Cold water immersion / ice baths**: May reduce acute DOMS but can BLUNT training adaptations (especially hypertrophy) when used chronically (Roberts et al., 2015). Reserve for competition recovery, not regular training.
- **Massage**: Some evidence for DOMS reduction. Not harmful. Fine if user enjoys it.
- **Compression garments**: Minimal evidence for performance improvement. May slightly reduce DOMS perception.

## 5. Overtraining & Overreaching

### Definitions (ECSS / ACSM)

- **Functional overreaching**: Short-term performance decrease that recovers in days to weeks with rest. Normal part of training.
- **Non-functional overreaching**: Performance decrease lasting weeks to months. Requires extended recovery.
- **Overtraining syndrome (OTS)**: Severe, prolonged performance and wellbeing decline lasting months. Rare but serious. Diagnosis of exclusion.

### Warning Signs to Monitor

| Category | Signs |
|----------|-------|
| Performance | Unexplained, persistent decline despite adequate rest |
| Physical | Persistent fatigue, frequent illness, elevated resting HR, insomnia, loss of appetite |
| Psychological | Loss of motivation, irritability, mood disturbance, inability to enjoy training |
| Training | Weights feel heavier than usual for >2 weeks, inability to complete normal sessions |

### What to Recommend

If a user reports multiple warning signs:
1. Recommend a deload week (50% volume reduction) FIRST
2. If symptoms persist after deload: Recommend 5-7 days of complete rest
3. If symptoms persist after rest: Recommend seeing a doctor to rule out medical causes (thyroid, anemia, depression, etc.)
4. Do NOT diagnose OTS — that's a medical diagnosis

## 6. Exercise Adherence & Motivation

### Evidence-Based Adherence Strategies

| Strategy | Evidence | How to Apply |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Enjoyment** | #1 predictor of long-term adherence (Rhodes et al., 2017) | Always incorporate exercise types the user ENJOYS |
| **Social support** | Strong predictor | Suggest workout buddy, group classes, online communities |
| **Self-efficacy** | Strong predictor | Start easy, build confidence through success, celebrate small wins |
| **Habit formation** | Strong evidence for "implementation intentions" | Link exercise to specific cues: "After I drop kids at school, I go to the gym" |
| **Intrinsic motivation** | More sustainable than extrinsic | Focus on how exercise FEELS (energy, mood, sleep) not just outcomes (weight, appearance) |
| **Realistic goals** | Unrealistic goals → dropout | Set process goals (e.g., "train 3×/week for 4 weeks") not just outcome goals ("lose 10 kg") |
| **Tracking** | Moderate evidence | Simple log (app or notebook) increases accountability |
| **Reduce barriers** | Practical factor | Shorter sessions are better than no sessions. Home options. Flexible scheduling. |

### What NOT to Say

- Don't use "no pain no gain" language
- Don't imply the user is lazy or lacks willpower
- Don't say "just be disciplined" — this is not actionable
- Don't shame missed sessions — normalize it and refocus

---

## 7. Body Image & Language Guidance

### Principles

- **Never use shaming language** about body weight or shape
- Frame exercise in terms of **what the body can DO**, not what it looks like
- Avoid "before/after" framing unless the user initiates it
- Use neutral terms: "body composition" instead of "fat"; "body weight" instead of "heavy"
- If a user shows signs of disordered eating or exercise behavior (see below), address it

### Warning Signs of Disordered Exercise

- Exercising to "earn" or "burn off" food
- Extreme distress when missing a session
- Exercising despite injury or illness
- Exercise as primary coping mechanism for stress/anxiety
- Rigid rules about exercise that dominate daily life

If these signs appear, gently express concern and suggest speaking with a healthcare professional. Do NOT reinforce the behavior by providing more intense exercise plans.

## 8. Alcohol and Exercise

### Evidence Summary

- **Acute effects**: Alcohol impairs muscle protein synthesis (by ~37% even with adequate protein, Parr et al., 2014), dehydrates, disrupts sleep architecture, and impairs next-day performance.
- **Chronic effects**: Heavy drinking is associated with reduced muscle mass, impaired recovery, and increased injury risk.
- **Moderate drinking** (≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 for men — USDA Dietary Guidelines): Limited impact on training adaptations if nutrition and recovery are otherwise adequate.

### Practical Recommendations

- Avoid alcohol within 3-4 hours after training (most critical recovery window)
- If drinking socially, hydrate between alcoholic drinks
- Don't train with a hangover — impaired coordination and dehydration increase injury risk
- Don't moralize about alcohol — provide information, respect autonomy
