# Test Case 2: English Intermediate · Home Gym · Strength · 4 Days/Week

**User Input:**
> I've been lifting for about 2 years. I can squat 100kg, bench 80kg, deadlift 120kg. I want to focus on strength gains. I train at home with a barbell, squat rack, adjustable dumbbells, and a pull-up bar. I can train 4 days a week, about 75 minutes each. I enjoy powerlifting-style training. No injuries but my left shoulder sometimes feels tight. I'm 32M, 180cm, 85kg.

---

**Claude Response:**

Solid numbers for two years. Here's a 4-day Upper/Lower split with Daily Undulating Periodization — alternating strength days (heavy, low reps) and hypertrophy days (moderate, higher reps).

Your left shoulder tightness is built in: shoulder mobility every upper warm-up, neutral-grip pressing on Friday.

**Equipment note:** I'm assuming you have a flat bench with your squat rack. If not, let me know and I'll swap to floor press throughout.

> ⚠️ This training plan is for informational and educational purposes only. If your shoulder tightness worsens or becomes painful, please consult a physiotherapist.

**Home Training Safety:**
- Set safety pins just below your lowest squat depth — practice bailing once at light weight
- Bench press: keep safety pins at chest level, or use dumbbells when pushing RPE 9
- Don't test true 1RM solo — cap at RPE 9

## Progression Plan (DUP, 4-Week Cycle)

**Strength Days (Mon & Tue):**

| Week | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Establish working weights at RPE 7-8 |
| 2 | Same weight, aim for top of rep range |
| 3 | Add 2.5kg to barbell compounds if RPE was ≤8 |
| 4 | Hold weight, push RPE to 8-9 on top sets |

**Hypertrophy Days (Thu & Fri):**

| Week | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Establish weights, focus on tempo and mind-muscle connection |
| 3-4 | Add 1 rep per set or increase weight slightly |

**Week 5 (Deload):** Reduce sets ~40%, keep weights same or -10%.

**12-week targets** (dependent on nutrition, sleep, consistency):
Squat 100→110-115kg | Bench 80→87.5-90kg | Deadlift 120→130-135kg

Keep a training log — record weight, reps, RPE for every working set.
