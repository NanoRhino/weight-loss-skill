"""
pre-send-check.py — Deterministic pre-send checks for meal/weight reminders.

Returns SEND or NO_REPLY (with reason on stderr for logging).
The model should NOT be invoked if this returns NO_REPLY.

Usage:
  python3 pre-send-check.py --workspace-dir <path> --meal-type <type> --tz-offset <seconds>

  --workspace-dir   Agent workspace root (contains health-profile.md, data/, etc.)
  --meal-type       One of: breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal_1, meal_2, weight,
                    weight_morning_followup
  --tz-offset       Timezone offset in seconds from UTC (e.g. 28800 for UTC+8)

Exit code 0 always. Output is exactly "SEND" or "NO_REPLY" on stdout.
Reason is printed to stderr for debugging.
