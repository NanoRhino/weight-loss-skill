name: streak-tracker
version: 1.0.0
description: >
  Calculates consecutive meal-logging streak and returns pending milestone data.
  Called BY other skills only — not a standalone conversation skill.

  WHEN to call:
  - notification-composer (Stage 1 only): during meal reminder Generation Flow
    step 4. If pending_milestone is not null, the milestone celebration becomes
    the opening line. If current_streak >= 2, use daily streak opening.
  - weekly-report: include current streak in the weekly summary section.
  - User explicitly asks about their streak ("what's my streak", etc.).

  WHEN NOT to call:
  - During recall phase (Stage 2/3/4) — no streak check, no streak mention.
  - During normal conversation — never proactively bring up streak unless
    the user asks or a milestone is pending at meal reminder time.
  - After a streak breaks — say nothing about it.

  DELIVERY: woven into meal reminders by notification-composer as the opening
  line. This skill never sends messages directly — only provides data.

  Returns: JSON with current_streak, pending_milestone, milestones_celebrated.

# Streak Tracker

> ⚠️ **SILENT OPERATION:** Never narrate internal actions or tool calls.

## Philosophy

1. **Celebrate presence, never punish absence.** Streak alive → amplify. Breaks → say nothing.
2. **Name the effort, not the number.** Connect milestones to what it took, not just the count.
3. **One celebration, then move on.** Don't revisit past milestones as motivation.
4. **Never compare.** Never reference longest streak or previous streaks.

## What Counts as a "Logged Day"

`data/meals/YYYY-MM-DD.json` contains at least one meal with actual food data (`items` or `foods` array non-empty), or `status: "logged"`.

## Script

```bash
# Get streak info (also persists to data/streak.json)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/streak-calc.py info \
  --data-dir {workspaceDir}/data/meals \
  --workspace-dir {workspaceDir} \
  --tz-offset {tz_offset}

# Mark milestone as celebrated
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/streak-calc.py celebrate \
  --data-dir {workspaceDir}/data/meals \
  --workspace-dir {workspaceDir} \
  --tz-offset {tz_offset} \
  --milestone <number>
```

### `info` output

```json
{
  "current_streak": 7,
  "longest_streak": 14,
  "streak_start_date": "2026-03-26",
  "last_logged_date": "2026-04-01",
  "today": "2026-04-02",
  "pending_milestone": 7,
  "milestones_celebrated": [3]
}
```

- `pending_milestone`: highest uncelebrated milestone reached. `null` if none.
- On streak break (current < max celebrated), `milestones_celebrated` resets automatically.

## Opening Line Rules

### Daily streak line (non-milestone days)

When `current_streak >= 2` and `pending_milestone` is null:

- State count as `current_streak - 1` (today's meal not logged yet).
- Add a free half about getting to know the user's eating habits. One sentence. Vary daily.
- Themes: learning their taste, noticing patterns, feeling closer. Always food-related.

### Milestone celebration

When `pending_milestone` is not null, **replace** the daily line with a bigger celebration. After sending, call `streak-calc.py celebrate --milestone <n>`.

**Milestones and examples → `references/streak-milestones.md`**

### No streak line

When `current_streak < 2`: compose the opening normally. No streak mention.

## Break Handling

- Script resets `milestones_celebrated` automatically on new streak.
- **Say nothing.** Never mention a broken streak or compare to previous.
- New streak day 1 starts silently. Milestone 3 re-celebrates as if first time.

## User Asks About Streak

Run `streak-calc.py info` and respond naturally:
- Active: state count and start date.
- None: frame as invitation ("Log a meal and that's day one.").

## Data Schema — `data/streak.json`

Persisted on every `streak-calc.py info` run. Other skills can read directly.

```json
{
  "current_streak": 7,
  "longest_streak": 14,
  "streak_start_date": "2026-03-26",
  "last_logged_date": "2026-04-01",
  "milestones_celebrated": [3, 7]
}
```

`longest_streak` preserved across streak resets.
