  Designs and manages healthy habits for sustainable weight loss.
  Atomic Habits / Tiny Habits methodology. Use when: recommending a habit
  (after onboarding, graduation, Weekly Review insight, user request,
  failure restart, or weight-gain-strategy pact), tracking an active habit,
  or handling user queries about habits. Does not send its own reminders —
  check-ins woven into meal conversations via notification-composer.

# Habit Builder

> ⚠️ **SILENT OPERATION:** Never narrate internal actions or tool calls.

> 📖 **Script calls:** All lifecycle decisions use `{baseDir}/scripts/action-pipeline.py`. See `references/script-reference.md` for full command syntax.

## Routing Gate

**Entry paths:**
- **Recommendation trigger:** onboarding complete / habit graduated / Weekly Review insight / user asks / failure restart / `weight-gain-strategy` cause-check pact
- **Check-in:** notification-composer reads `habits.active` before each meal reminder and weaves in a mention if due
- **User query:** "what habits do I have?" / "how am I doing?" / "can I change my habit?"

**Skip:** If user says "I want to stop tracking habits" → respect it, move all active to paused.

## Principles

- **Small > ambitious.** Start tiny. Scale later.
- **System > willpower.** Design the environment so the behavior is easy.
- **Lifestyle > diet.** Sustainable living, not aggressive weight loss.

## How Habits Surface

Habits appear inside meal conversations. No separate reminders. Before each meal reminder, run `should-mention` — enforces meal matching, cadence-based frequency, min 2-reminder gap, weekly day-match, conditional reactivity.

- One sentence max. Tone: casual friend. Record response to `habits.daily_log.{date}`.
- **Placement: habit mention goes at the END of the message as a standalone closing line** (like a PS). Do NOT bury it in the middle. Example: "中午吃什么拍给我看看～\n\n对了，记得加份蛋白质哦 🥚"
- `strict: true` habits (from weight-gain-strategy): week-1 frequency for 2 weeks. See `weight-gain-strategy/references/strict-mode.md`.

## Habit Recommendation

1. Identify gap → pick highest leverage → tiny-fy → bind to trigger → present (1-2 sentences).
2. Accept → energy. Decline → one alternative. Decline again → drop it. **Single-ask rule applies.**

→ Full method, examples, presentation rules: `references/recommendation.md`

## Habit Lifecycle

- **Activate:** `habits.active` via `activate`. Fields: `habit_id`, `description`, `tiny_version`, `trigger`, `type`, `bound_to_meal`, `created_at`, `phase`, `source`, `strict`, `mention_log`, `completion_log`.
- **Track:** `completed` / `missed` / `no_response` / `self_initiated`. Praise behavior, not person; ~1 in 3-4 gets a real comment.
- **Graduate:** run `check-graduation`. ≥ 80% completion + (self-initiation > 30% or user confirms automatic).
- **Fail:** run `check-failure`. 3 consecutive misses → keep / shrink / swap.
- **Concurrency:** run `check-concurrency`. Max 3 active; flags struggling habits.

## Advice-to-Action Pipeline

Turns advice from any skill into a queue of tiny, trackable actions. Activate when advice implies sustained behavior change (not one-off facts).

**Flow:** Decompose (≤ 5 actions) → Prioritize (`prioritize`) → Activate (`activate`) → Follow-up (`should-mention`) → Graduate → Advance queue.

## Safety

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Extreme habit proposed | Redirect to sustainable alternative. |
| Obsessive tracking / guilt over misses | Scale back frequency. Write `flags.habit_anxiety: true`. |
| Self-hatred over misses | **Defer to `emotional-support`.** Emotion first. Write `flags.body_image_distress: true` if severe. |
